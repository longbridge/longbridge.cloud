    "p4": "As its business continues to scale, Whale has expanded access to major global financial markets. The platform now integrates with a growing network of product issuers, custodian banks, exchanges, and leading news and market data service providers. Beyond Hong Kong and U.S. equities, Whale’s offerings now cover wealth management, virtual assets, structured products, funds, and more. Its client base has also broadened from securities firms to include banks, family offices, and other institutional clients with investment service needs.",
    "p5": "To date, Whale has developed into a fully integrated global trading platform and a hub for multi-asset trading activities at over 100 financial institutions worldwide. Reflecting this new stage of growth, the brand has been upgraded to LONGPORT Whale.",
